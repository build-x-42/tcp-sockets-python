# TCP socket in python



## TDD

TDD (Test-Driven Development) is a software development process where you write tests before writing the code to pass the tests. It helps in building more reliable and maintainable code. Here's a to-do list to build a TCP socket in Python using TDD:

1. Create a new Python project directory and set up a virtual environment.
2. Install required packages, such as pytest for testing.
3. Write tests for the following basic functionalities:
   a. Test that a server socket can be created.
   b. Test that a client socket can connect to the server socket.
   c. Test that data can be sent from the client to the server.
   d. Test that data can be received by the server from the client.
   e. Test that data can be sent from the server to the client.
   f. Test that data can be received by the client from the server.
   g. Test that a server can handle multiple clients.
   h. Test that the sockets can be closed properly.

4. Start implementing the TCP socket by creating a Python module for the server.
   a. Import the necessary libraries (socket, threading, etc.).
   b. Define a function to create a server socket.
   c. Define a function to accept incoming client connections.
   d. Define a function to handle client connections.
   e. Define a function to send data to the client.
   f. Define a function to receive data from the client.
   g. Define a function to close the server socket.

5. Run the tests for the server module and fix any errors or failures.

6. Create a Python module for the client.
   a. Import the necessary libraries (socket, etc.).
   b. Define a function to create a client socket.
   c. Define a function to connect to the server.
   d. Define a function to send data to the server.
   e. Define a function to receive data from the server.
   f. Define a function to close the client socket.

7. Run the tests for the client module and fix any errors or failures.

8. Write integration tests to verify that the server and client modules work together correctly.
   a. Test that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
   b. Test that the server and clients can send and receive data in various scenarios.
   c. Test error handling, such as invalid IP addresses, ports, or data.

9. Run the integration tests and fix any errors or failures.

10. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability, if necessary.

11. Update and finalize the documentation for the TCP socket implementation.

12. Perform a final round of testing to ensure that everything is working as expected.

After completing these steps, you should have a working TCP socket implementation in Python, built using TDD principles.
